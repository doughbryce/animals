<h2>Origin Information</h2>
	<article>
		<h3>Location</h3>
			The Emperor tamarin is a small species of monkey found in the forests of South America.
			<br>
		<h3>Subspecies</h3>
			There are two subspecies of Emperor tamarin found in the south west Amazon Basin. The bearded emperor tamarin inhabits the rainforests throughout Brazil and Peru, and the black-chinned emperor tamarin that actually has no beard and is distributed throughout the rainforests of Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia. <br>
		<h3>Distribution</h3>
			Emperor tamarins are found in the southwest Amazon Basin. The countries of their origin are southeast Peru, northwest Bolivia, and northwest Brazil. River drainages in Peru such as the Acre, Purus, and Jurua have populations of emperor tamarins. <br>
		<h3>Adaptations</h3>
			Two-thirds of the female emperor tamarins are trichomats; they see three colors.  This type of vision allows the females to have an easier time detecting ripe fruit. The rest of the females and all of the males are dichromats; they only detect two colors giving them an advantage detecting predators and prey which are camouflaged. <br> <br>

			Their light weight and small size allows them to get to the ends of branches and twigs where larger monkeys are not able to. Their stature also allows them to be quick, shifty "leapers" helping them catch their prey and escape from their predators. <br> <br>

			Their tail (which is longer than their body) acts a fifth hand by gripping branches. Emperor tamarins have much longer fingers than their relatives, which aid in the snatching of their prey rather than having to probe for trey in the trees. Their claws are believed to be an adaptation to their environment instead of a passed down trait of their phylogenetic ancestors. <br> <br>

			It is common for emperor tamarins to have a mutualistic relationship with saddleback tamarins. Emperor tamarins live in the higher levels of the jungle canopy and watch for danger from above. They also flush prey down to the lower levels for the saddlebacks. The saddleback tamarins in return offer protection to the emperor tamarins by detecting predators from below. <br> <br>
